This example demonstrates sharing horizontal grid between grids.

This setting can be quite useful in earth models when different domains (e.g.
ocean, sea ice, atmosphere) can be on the same horizontal grid. It saves memory
and avoids redundant computation of ensemble transforms in CALC.

In this particular case eta_t, on one hand, and temp and salt, on another hand, 
are put on different grids that share the same horizontal grid. Note that there
are no transforms-1.nc and enkf_diag-1.nc files after CALC, as those would be
equivalent to transforms-0.nc and enkf_diag-0.nc.
